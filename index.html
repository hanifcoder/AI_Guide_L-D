            <h3>✨ What is AI?</h3>
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science focused on
              creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like
              intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
              It’s about building systems that can think and act rationally.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> An AI tool helps you analyze a large
              bank of old course materials to identify redundant content, saving
              you hours of manual review.
            </p>

            <h3>🧠 Key AI Techniques</h3>
          </summary>
          <div>
            <h4>Machine Learning (ML)</h4>
            <p>
              Machine learning is a core AI technique that enables a machine to
              learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It's about
              training a model on data so it can make predictions or decisions
              on its own.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> For a Learning Relationship Manager, an
              ML model analyzes performance data from past training sessions to
              predict which new hires might need personalized follow-up
              coaching.
            </p>

            <h4>Generative AI</h4>
            <p>
              Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content, such as
              text, images, or code. It learns patterns from existing data to
              produce original, coherent outputs. Large Language Models (LLMs)
              are a key part of this field.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> For a Facilitator, you use a generative
              AI tool to create five different versions of a role-play scenario
              for a negotiation skills workshop, providing variety for your
              learners.
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            <h3>📚 Understanding Data</h3>
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              Data is the foundation of AI. The quality and type of data used to
              train AI models are critical.
            </p>
            <h4>Structured vs. Unstructured Data</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Structured Data:</strong> Highly organized data that
                follows a fixed format, like information in a spreadsheet or
                database. <br /><strong>Example:</strong> A spreadsheet tracking
                learner scores on a knowledge check.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> Data without a predefined
                format, like text, audio, and video files. <br /><strong
                  >Example:</strong
                >
                A transcript from a feedback session with a learner, which can
                be analyzed by an AI to identify common themes.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </details>

            <h3>🚀 Optimizing AI with Prompt Engineering</h3>
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs
              (prompts) to get the desired output from an AI model. It is a
              critical skill for working with tools like Copilot.
            </p>

            <h3>📝 Practical Challenges</h3>
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              Even with powerful AI tools, there are challenges to be aware of,
              particularly regarding consistency and accuracy.
            </p>
            <h4>Inconsistency and Hallucination</h4>
            <p>
              AI models can sometimes produce outputs that are inconsistent or
              factually incorrect (known as "hallucination"). This happens when
              the model generates content that isn't supported by its training
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> A Copilot-generated summary of a
              benefits policy might include a benefit that doesn't actually
              exist. This is why human review and validation are essential.
